# Package Management

To streamline cross-distro package management, Helios uses a centralized `packages.yaml` system. This allows each logical package to be mapped to its appropriate name for each Linux distribution, while also enabling distros to inherit shared definitions from one or more package groups.

---

## Structure of `packages.yaml`

### `packages` Section

Each item in the `packages` array defines a **single logical package**, and includes distro-specific keys for the corresponding package names:

```yaml
packages:
  - debian: mesa-va-drivers        # VA-API support for Debian
    rhel: mesa-va-drivers          # Same package name for RHEL
    alpine: mesa-va-gallium        # Different package name for Alpine

  - debian: libx11-6
    rhel: libX11
    alpine: libx11

  - debian: extra-debian-only-pkg
```

This format enables clean mapping between distros for the same logical dependency, and avoids repeating similar entries in multiple places.

### `inherit` Section

This section defines which **groups of package mappings** each distro should inherit from.

```yaml
inherit:
  ubuntu:
    - common
    - debian
  alpine:
    - common
  debian:
    - common
  rhel:
    - common
```

In this example:

- **Ubuntu** inherits all packages defined under the `common` and `debian` groups.
- **RHEL**, **Debian**, and **Alpine** all inherit from the `common` group.
- Each distro may also have its own explicitly defined packages.

---

## Package List Generation

A preprocessing step flattens the data into a list of distro-specific packages, combining:

1. All package mappings from the inherited groups
2. Any mappings explicitly defined for that distro

Each distro’s final list is saved as:

```
/tmp/lists/<distro>.list
```

For example, `/tmp/lists/ubuntu.list` will include packages from:
- The `common` group
- The `debian` group
- Any Ubuntu-specific entries (if present)

---

### Build Integration

These generated lists are used directly in the image build process. Example from `alma-9/build/system.sh`:

```bash
dnf install -y --allowerasing --setopt=install_weak_deps=False --best \
  $(cat /tmp/lists/rhel.list) \
  fastfetch
```

This example installs the complete set of packages for a RHEL-based image (including inherited packages from `common`).
