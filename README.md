# 🚀 Helios

Helios provides base images for multiple key Linux distributions, optimized to be as small as possible to:

- Reduce pull times  
- Minimize the attack surface  
- Lower data transfer costs  

These images are lightweight, efficient, and ready to use across environments like Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

Some key points about Helios:

- **Base Images**: Designed as base images for Kasm-compatible deployments.  
- **Extremely Minimal Desktops**: Images are intentionally minimal; avoid adding software directly. Instead, extend via the `FROM` instruction in your Dockerfile.

## 🏷️ Versioning

Helios uses its own versioning scheme independent of the underlying distro versions. The format is: `v0.0.0-codename` where `codename` represents the underlying distro. This allows tracking Helios changes separately from distro updates.

### Examples

| Helios Version    | Distro               |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| `v0.0.0-bookworm` | Debian 12 (Bookworm) |
| `v0.0.0-alpine-3` | Alpine (3)           |
| `v0.0.0-noble`    | Ubuntu 24.04         |
| `v0.0.0-jammy`    | Ubuntu 22.04         |
| `v0.0.0-kali`     | Kali Linux           |
| `v0.0.0-rocky-9`  | Rocky Linux          |
| `v0.0.0-alma-9`   | Alma Linux           |

## Usage

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the Helios container. The following environment variables are available:

| Name      | Value                              | Required |
|-----------|------------------------------------|----------|
| USER      | Name of the user                   | X        |
| UID       | POSIX compliant uid for the user   | X        |
| GID       | POSIX compliant gid for the user   |          |
| PASSWORD  | Password set for the user          |          |
| IDLE_TIME | Trigger the idle hook after x time |          |

> [!TIP]  
> The `GID` will match the `UID` if not specified.

> [!TIP]  
> The `UID` and `GID` are NOT the user that is launching and running the container. 
> Because of s6, the container always starts and runs as root. It then uses s6 to run the desktop using the specified 
> user using those environment variables. This is done to ensure that the desktop has the correct permissions and 
> ownership on things like the home directory and other files. This helps with things like Network Shares as well.

> [!CAUTION]
> Helios DOES NOT provide any authentication for connecting to the workstation. This means that anyone who can
> connect to the http endpoint can access the desktop as that user. For proper security, we recommend using a 
> reverse proxy with authentication in front of Helios. This can be done using Nginx, Traefik, or any other 
> reverse proxy that supports authentication.
> 
> Security is a very important part of any deployment and it isn't a one size fits all solution. Instead of shipping
> Helios with a specific authentication method, we leave it up to the user to implement their own security measures
> that best fit their deployment. This allows for more flexibility and customization in how Helios is used.

### Ports

Helios exposes the following ports:

| Port | Description       |
|------|-------------------|
| 3000 | HTTP Desktop Port |

### Deployment

Helios is meant to be launched in a number of different ways. It works as a standalone docker container as well as being
k8s ready. The following examples show how to run Helios in different environments.


#### Docker
You can run Helios in a Docker container using the following command:

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name helios \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e USER=bob \
  -e UID=1000 \
  helios:v0.0.0-noble
``` 

#### Docker Compose

You can also use Docker Compose to run Helios. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
   helios:
      image: helios:v0.0.0-noble
      hostname: "helios"
      container_name: helios
      environment:
         - USER=helios
         - UID=1000
      ports:
         - "3000:3000"
```

#### Kubernetes

You can run Helios in a Kubernetes cluster using the following manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
   name: helios
spec:
   serviceName: helios
   replicas: 1
   selector:
      matchLabels:
         app: helios
   template:
      metadata:
         labels:
            app: helios
      spec:
         containers:
            - name: helios
              image: helios:v0.0.0-noble
              ports:
                 - containerPort: 3000
              env:
                 - name: USER
                   value: "helios"
                 - name: UID
                   value: "1000"
```

## Customizing Helios


### 📦 Unified Package Management

To streamline cross-distro package management, Helios uses a centralized `packages.yaml` system. This allows each logical package to be mapped to its appropriate name for each Linux distribution, while also enabling distros to inherit shared definitions from one or more package groups.

---

#### 🔧 Structure of `packages.yaml`

##### `packages` Section

Each item in the `packages` array defines a **single logical package**, and includes distro-specific keys for the corresponding package names:

```yaml
packages:
  - debian: mesa-va-drivers        # VA-API support for Debian
    rhel: mesa-va-drivers          # Same package name for RHEL
    alpine: mesa-va-gallium        # Different package name for Alpine

  - debian: libx11-6
    rhel: libX11
    alpine: libx11

  - debian: extra-debian-only-pkg
```

This format enables clean mapping between distros for the same logical dependency, and avoids repeating similar entries in multiple places.

##### `inherit` Section

This section defines which **groups of package mappings** each distro should inherit from.

```yaml
inherit:
  ubuntu:
    - common
    - debian
  alpine:
    - common
  debian:
    - common
  rhel:
    - common
```

In this example:

- **Ubuntu** inherits all packages defined under the `common` and `debian` groups.
- **RHEL**, **Debian**, and **Alpine** all inherit from the `common` group.
- Each distro may also have its own explicitly defined packages.

---

#### 📤 Package List Generation

A preprocessing step flattens the data into a list of distro-specific packages, combining:

1. All package mappings from the inherited groups
2. Any mappings explicitly defined for that distro

Each distro’s final list is saved as:

```
/tmp/lists/<distro>.list
```

For example, `/tmp/lists/ubuntu.list` will include packages from:
- The `common` group
- The `debian` group
- Any Ubuntu-specific entries (if present)

---

#### 🧱 Build Integration

These generated lists are used directly in the image build process. Example from [`alma-9/build/system.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juno-fx/Helios/refs/heads/48-unify-package-list-clean/alma-9/build/system.sh):

```bash
dnf install -y --allowerasing --setopt=install_weak_deps=False --best \
  $(cat /tmp/lists/rhel.list) \
  fastfetch
```

This example installs the complete set of packages for a RHEL-based image (including inherited packages from `common`).

---

#### ✅ Benefits

- 🔄 **Cross-distro compatibility**: One source of truth for logical packages across platforms
- 🔧 **Easier maintenance**: Update a single YAML file instead of multiple build scripts
- ♻️ **Reusability**: Define shared groups (`common`, `debian`, etc.) and reuse across distros
- 🔍 **Transparency**: Final package lists are explicitly generated and easy to inspect

---

### 🏗️ Using `FROM`

Helios images can be used as a base in your own Dockerfiles with the `FROM` instruction.

For example, to build on top of the Ubuntu 24.04 Helios image:

```dockerfile
FROM helios:v0.0.0-noble

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y htop
```

You can then push your custom image to a private registry and deploy it in Kasm-compatible environments.

---

#### ✅ Benefits

- 🚀 **Quick Start**: Leverage prebuilt, tested base images to speed up your container builds.
- 🔄 **Consistency**: Builds start from a known, reliable foundation, reducing surprises.
- 🔧 **Customizability**: Easily extend Helios images to fit your specific application or environment needs.
- 📦 **Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrate with Kasm and other container orchestration platforms.

---

### ⚙️ Event Hooks

Helios uses the [s6 overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) init system from [just-containers](https://github.com/just-containers).  
This allows us to hook into the container boot sequence to run custom scripts and services. The design is heavily inspired by the excellent work from [Linuxserver IO](https://www.linuxserver.io/).

> [!TIP]  
> The init hook executes **before** the user environment is fully set up, but you have full access to environment variables and the filesystem.

---

#### 🛠️ Custom Services

Custom services are managed through the `/etc/helios/services.d` directory. You can add your own by either:

- Overriding `/etc/helios/services.d/custom.sh` in your Dockerfile  
- Mounting your scripts into the container

These services will run in the background as part of the container lifecycle.

---

#### 🏗️ Using `FROM`

You can extend Helios images by adding your custom init scripts and services in your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM helios:v0.0.0-noble

# Custom init script
COPY ./my-custom-init.sh /etc/helios/init.d/my-custom-init.sh

# Custom service
COPY ./my-custom-service.sh /etc/helios/services.d/custom.sh

# Custom idle script
COPY ./my-custom-idle.sh /etc/helios/idle.d/custom.sh
```

---

#### 🔌 Mounting Scripts Dynamically

Alternatively, mount scripts at runtime via Docker or Kubernetes volume mounts. This lets you add or update scripts without rebuilding the image — great for development and testing.

Example Docker run command:

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name my-helios-container \
  -v /path/to/my-custom-init.sh:/etc/helios/init.d/my-custom-init.sh \
  -v /path/to/my-custom-service.sh:/etc/helios/services.d/custom.sh \
  -v /path/to/my-custom-idle.sh:/etc/helios/idle.d/custom.sh \
  helios:v0.0.0-noble
```

Example Kubernetes ConfigMap and Deployment snippet to mount the scripts:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-helios-config
data:
  my-custom-idle.sh: |
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Helios has hit the idle timeout!"
  
  my-custom-init.sh: |
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Hello from my custom init script!"
  
  my-custom-service.sh: |
    #!/bin/bash

    set -e

    echo
    echo "Helios Custom Service Initialization"
    echo
    /path/to/my/custom/script.sh
    /path/to/my/other/custom/script.sh
    sleep infinity

        volumeMounts:
          - name: custom-scripts
            mountPath: /etc/helios/init.d/my-custom-init.sh
            subPath: my-custom-init.sh
          - name: custom-services
            mountPath: /etc/helios/services.d/custom.sh
            subPath: my-custom-service.sh
          - name: custom-idle
            mountPath: /etc/helios/idle.d/custom.sh
            subPath: my-custom-idle.sh
      volumes:
        - name: custom-scripts

        - name: custom-idle
          configMap:
            name: my-helios-config
```

## Contributing

Contributions to Helios are welcome! We just ask that you evaluate what you actually need to adjust. This repo is not
meant to provide a fully built desktop with all the bells and whistles. It is meant to provide a base image
that others can build on top of. That means most changes to Helios should be geared towards adding new distros,
optimizing the build process, or upgrading part of the Helios stack. If you have a specific use case that requires
a change to Helios, please open an issue or a pull request with a detailed explanation of the change and why it is
necessary.

### Build Process

All builds are run through a single Dockerfile which is at the root of the repository. This describes the standard
procedure to build a Helios container. There are a few rules.

1. NOTHING distro specific should ever be added to the Dockerfile.
    - The only exception is the Ubuntu stage which generates the snakeoil certificates which are then copied into the common rootfs. This is used to satisfy the requirement for KasmVNC to launch on RHEL based distros.
2. All builds MUST be run through the Dockerfile at the root of the repository. This ensures that the build process is consistent across all distros and all versions are uniform.
3. The Dockerfile is heavily monitored for changes and any proposed changes will require a very detailed explanation of why the change is necessary and how it will affect the build process. As of right now, there is no reason to modify the Dockerfile as it provides hooks in the rest of the repo to do anything you want.

### Repository Layout

The repository is laid out as follows.

```
common
├── build <- Common build scripts for all distros
└── root <- Modified rootfs for all distros
<distro>
├── build <- Distro specific build scripts
└── root <- Distro specific rootfs
```

### Package Changes

We recommend you follow the [Unified Package Management System](#-unified-package-management).

### Build Order

1. `common/build/novnc.sh` is run to build the noVNC client. (This is standard across all distros)
2. `<distro>/build/kasm.sh` is run to install the distro specific packages and dependencies to build the KasmVNC server and the custom X server.
3. `common/build/turbo.sh` is run to build the custom libjpeg-turbo required by KasmVNC server. (This is standard across all distros)
4. `common/build/kasm.sh` is run to build the KasmVNC server. (This is standard across all distros)
5. `<distro>/build/xorg.sh` is run to build the X server. Depending on the distro, it will change which X version is built. This is the case for RHEL distros for example.
6. `<distro>/build/kclient.sh` is run to install Node for the distro. This changes per distro as some distros have different package managers or versions of Node available.
7. `common/build/kclient.sh` is run to build the kclient client. (This is standard across all distros)

   > We do apply a helios.patch to the kclient that removes the fileserver functionality as well as automatically enable audio by default.

8. `common/build/package.sh` is run in the build stage to generate the rootfs containing, kclient, KasmVNC server, custom X server, and noVNC client.
9. `<distro>/root` is then copied into a fresh image with all distro specific files and configurations.
10. We then copy the packaged rootfs from the build stage to a fresh flattened image which "installs" Kasm
11. `<distro>/build/system.sh` is run to install the distro specific packages and dependencies to finalize the deliverable image.
12. `common/root` is copied into the image to provide the common rootfs files.

### Shared Configuration Changes

You can modify the shared configuration files in the `common/root` directory to customize the resulting rootfs.
For example, you can reference the `common/root/etc/kasm/kasmvnc.conf` file to change the default settings for KasmVNC.

### Distro Specific Configuration Changes

You can modify the distro specific configuration files in the `<distro>/root` directory to customize the resulting rootfs
for that specific distro. For example, you can reference the `<distro>/root/etc/skel/.bashrc` file to change the default
settings for the shell on that specific distro.

### Development Workflow

Development on Helios is meant to be as easy as possible.

#### Pre-requisites

1. **Devbox**: Install Devbox from their official [website](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing_devbox/)

#### Workflow

1. Clone this repository and change into the directory.
2. Run `devbox shell` to enter the development environment.
3. Run `make <distro>` to build the desired distro. For example, `make noble` will build the Ubuntu 24.04 image.
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to access the Kasm web client.
5. Formatting your changes is done by running `make format`.

> [!TIP]
> The make targets essentially launch `docker compose`. If you need to try other deployment configurations, such as 
> accessing a local graphics card, you can modify the `compose.yml` file in the root of the repository and run 
> `make <distro>` to start the container with your custom configuration. Please make sure to change this file back to 
> the original state before committing your changes.
